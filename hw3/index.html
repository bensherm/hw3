        My name is Ben Sherman.For as long as I can remember I have always enjoyed learning how things worked. The process's that go on behind the scenes have always been intriguing to me. In High School working at golf courses I would spent downtime doing my own research on how clubs were made, the technology that goes into the golf ball, and even course care. This natural curiousity when I came of age led to an interest in the process of making beer. Not only the physical process but the creativity of recipie crafting gripped me. Different hops added at different times, different grain bills, different ferementation temperatures, and yeast combinations allowed for so much experimentation and discovery I sought out all the information I could get my hands on. Having spent the last two years at Railroad Brewing Company in Avon as assistant brewer I've been fortunate enough to expand that knowledge. As time has gone on friends of mine in the Tech industry have caught my ear about the process and creativity involved in Software development leading me to desire a career path as a Full Stack developer.

        All during this time I began dating and was married to the lovely Amy Sherman in November 2017, and we even got a Basset hound puppy named Lucy! Being crazy dog lovers we spend alot of our time together on walks and at the parks all over The Cleveland area

            <h4>Outdoors</h4>
                <p>
                    I love everything outdoors. Hiking, backbacking, biking, and rock climbing to name a few favorite activities. During nice weather you bet you can find me on a trail if I have the time! I've always had an interest in fishing, but due to cost and time its one hobby I haven't managed to pickup quite yet.
                </p>
            <h4>Games</h4>
                <p>
                    A component of my freetime is that I really enjoy board games! I have a weekly game night with a few friends where we get together and socialize around the table while playing a game. I really enjoy the tactile feel of the pieces as opposed to video games, figuring out a fun puzzle, and getting together with friends.
                </p>
            <h4>Books</h4>
                <P>
                    Reading is one of the things that i enjoy most in my freetime, and never seem to have enough time to do it. Audio books have been a huge asset for me in this department as I can "read" on the go. I try to have a system where I will read one book for pleasure, and then one that makes me think. I have been working through a booklist that a podcast I subscribe to put up. This list deals with many topics such as philosophy, culture, and mystery which I've been enjoying alot!
