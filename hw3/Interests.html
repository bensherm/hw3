        <h3>Outdoors</h3>
        <p> I love everything outdoors. Hiking, backbacking, biking, and rock climbing to name a few favorite activities. During nice weather you bet you can find me on a trail if I have the time! I've always had an interest in fishing, but due to cost and time its one hobby I haven't managed to pickup quite yet.</p>
        
        <h3>Games</h3>
        <p> A component of my freetime is that I really enjoy board games! I have a weekly game night with a few friends where we get together and socialize around the table while playing a game. I really enjoy the tactile feel of the pieces as opposed to video games, figuring out a fun puzzle, and getting together with friends. </p>
        
        <h3>Books</h3>
        <p>Reading is one of the things that i enjoy most in my freetime, and never seem to have enough time to do it. Audio books have been a huge asset for me in this department as I can "read" on the go. I try to have a system where I will read one book for pleasure, and then one that makes me think. I have been working through a booklist that a podcast I subscribe to put up. This list deals with many topics such as philosophy, culture, and mystery which I've been enjoying alot!</p>
